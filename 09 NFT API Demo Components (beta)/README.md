# NFT API Demo Components
I've included a number of components that you can use in a react application to test some of the functionality of some NFT API endpoints.

## Fork the Ethereum Boilerplate
You will firstly need to clone the Ethereum Boilerplate project (https://github.com/ethereum-boilerplate/ethereum-boilerplate)
Then fork these files and put them into the src -> components folder.
Tidy up and remove the sections you don't want/need in your project

## The code is rough
Just be aware that my code bank will not be maintained regularly, it was purely built as a simple demonstration for how to use a few of the API endpoints in a react application. If you use this code, you will need to maintain it. 

I used a combination of react function components (some using hooks, some not) and react class components (the benefit of class components are that I can use vanilla js). It's possible that this code bank will require refactoring to make it more efficient. 

Some of the API endpoints are not connected, but you can connect them if you wish. 

## Dependencies
Dependencies for this code bank:
- antd 
- axios
Install them both with this:
```npm i axios antd```
